## 1. Purpose

0.0.8.0 redirects effort from **substrate-ahead-of-need** to **consumer-pulled integration**
(`design_0_0_8_1.md` §1, §5). The 0.0.7.9 track proved large, correct, opt-in/default-off substrate
that nothing in production consumed — and generated hygiene loops (recombination soaks, accounting-over-
accounting, passive proof wrappers) while waiting for a consumer.

**This track operationalizes SCENARIO-FIRST authoring:** the next artifact is a **named product
scenario**, not another fixture, soak, replay, accounting summary, manifest, or substrate expansion.
A substrate's production-path gate opens **only because a named scenario consumes it** — never
speculatively.

This is not implementation. This is not a substrate track. This is not another proof wrapper.

**ClauseThing / ClauseScript** remains a horizontal future authoring surface. Scenario admission
must not assume ClauseThing support, but should avoid choices that would make a future ClauseThing
front-end impossible.

---

## 2. Operating doctrine summary

- **Guardrails at designer/spec admission; runtime enforces hard safety** (`design_0_0_8_1.md` §2.1;
  `invariants.md` two-layer guardrail placement).
- **Tier-1 fast-lane** — accepted, generic/semantic-free, opt-in/default-off, parity-backed,
  reversible work ships as one implementation PR + one test report + one status-row update
  (`phase_m_gating_and_doc_policy.md` §1).
- **Tier-2 gate** — new scenario gates, default `SimSession`, default schedule, gameplay surface,
  semantic WGSL, invariant edits, new architecture, or closed-ladder reopen.
- **Proven-capability stop rule** — no passive proof wrappers unless they unlock execution
  (`phase_m_gating_and_doc_policy.md` §6; 0.0.7.9 track §2.2).
- **One principle per class; no per-slice accretion** (`design_0_0_8_1.md` §2.5).

---

## 3. ClauseThing horizon non-goal

ClauseThing / ClauseScript is a **horizontal future designer-facing aspiration** — not active
scope for this track.

- This track does **not** open ClauseThing.
- This track does **not** require ClauseScript expressiveness.
- This track does **not** alter `simthing-spec`.
- Scenario packets should target the **current accepted `simthing-spec` admission surface**
  (L0/L1/L2 / CLAUSE-SPEC).
- Future ClauseThing compatibility is a **non-blocking horizon concern only** — avoid admission
  choices that would foreclose a later front-end, but do not design for ClauseScript now.

---

## 4. Parked substrate inventory

Compact reference only — do not re-litigate. Each row is **complete or accepted at first slice,
opt-in/default-off, parked** until a named scenario pulls it.

| Capability | State | Opens when… |
|---|---|---|
| **0.0.7.9 mobility/transfer substrate** (ALLOC, REENROLL, IDROUTE, ECON, OWNER + RUNTIME-0/1A/1B + semantic-free GPU kernel substrate) | COMPLETE + PARKED | a named scenario needs mobility/ownership/economy in the default `SimSession` path |
| **Line A — nested Resource Flow (A-0)** | ACCEPTED, static nested first slice; production posture is `FlatStarResourceFlow` | a named economy needs depth>2 nested fanout |
| **Line B — discrete hard-currency ordering (B-0)** | ACCEPTED, narrow smoke; no B-1 | a named multi-transaction hard-currency workload |
| **Line C — atlas / multi-theater mapping (C-0/C-1/C-2)** | ACCEPTED; map batching CLOSED at designer surface | a named multi-theater scenario opens the atlas production runtime gate |
| **simthing-spec / CLAUSE-SPEC (L0/L1/L2)** | ACCEPTED designer-admission substrate | engine of this track's scenario authoring |
| **ClauseThing / ClauseScript (L3)** | PARKED pending product authorization | product authorizes the front-end |
| **Deferred-by-design** | E-11B-5, atlas production runtime, B-1, Hybrid-Strata/faction-index ECON scaling, FrontierV2-5, ACT/EVENT/OBS/PIPE | each requires its own named product scenario or product authorization — not open questions |

---

## 5. First gate: SCENARIO-0080-0

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Gate ID** | `SCENARIO-0080-0` |
| **Type** | Tier-2 scenario/admission gate |
| **Deliverable** | Named product-scenario / admission packet |
| **Packet** | [`scenarios/scenario_0080_0_admission_packet.md`](scenarios/scenario_0080_0_admission_packet.md) — **Local Patrol Economy** — **ACCEPTED 2026-06-02** ([acceptance review](tests/phase_scenario_0080_0_acceptance_review_results.md)) |
| **Design-authority enrichment** | Patrol relocate decision sourced from the accepted GPU-resident FIELD_POLICY `Threshold`+`EmitEvent`→`BoundaryRequest` posture (not a CPU planner; no new substrate pulled) — scenario exercises FIELD_POLICY + Ownership + Flow |
| **Runtime implementation** | **No** |
| **On acceptance** | Opened **only** the mobility/transfer production-path gate (`PRODUCTION-PATH-0080-0`, below) |

---

## 6. SCENARIO-0080-0 admission packet — required declarations

The admission packet must declare:

1. **Scenario name and product purpose**
2. **User-facing / product behavior** the scenario is meant to enable
3. **Which one parked substrate** it consumes (exactly one)
4. **Why that substrate is required now** (consumer pull — not speculative substrate build)
5. **Bounds and scale**
6. **Designer/spec admission vocabulary**
7. **Rejection vocabulary and diagnostics**
8. **Runtime path requested**, if any
9. **Whether production default path is requested**
10. **Whether default schedule is requested**
11. **Whether gameplay-facing integration is requested**
12. **Test/evidence needed for admission**
13. **Explicit non-goals**
14. **Exit criteria for acceptance**

Acceptance is **design-authority + product only**. No self-acceptance.

---

## 7. Recommended first candidate (not authorization)

**Most-ready candidate:** 0.0.7.9 mobility/transfer substrate.

**Reason:** Its production-path gate is already mapped as the first non-test-support default
`SimSession` path / default schedule (0.0.7.9 track top status; MOBILITY-SCENARIO-0 accepted the
scenario discipline).

**Constraint:** It must still be **pulled by a named product scenario**. Do not open
`PRODUCTION-PATH-0080-0` speculatively.

---

## 8. Stop conditions

Reject the scenario if it requires any of:

- owner-entity as spatial parent
- capture-as-reparenting
- semantic/raw WGSL
- default-on behavior without a production gate
- hard-currency through Resource Flow
- CPU planner / urgency / commitment emission
- reopening atlas runtime, E-11B-5, B-1, ClauseThing/L3 front-end, FrontierV2-5, ACT/EVENT/OBS/PIPE,
  Hybrid-Strata/faction-index scaling, or any closed ladder without its own product authorization
- passive proof wrappers that do not unlock execution

| `PRODUCTION-PATH-0080-1` | `SCENARIO-0080-1` opt-in production path | **IMPLEMENTED / PASS — opt-in Nested Starmap production-path composition** — composes implemented/pass `ATLAS-0080-0` (sparse residency) + `ECON-SCALE-0080-0` (faction-index ECON) reports into one inspectable scenario report; owner-overlay inheritance + ownership up-aggregation are numeric summaries; FIELD_POLICY composite-gap terms are read-only; **no schedule/movement, no new substrate**.

| `DEFAULT-SCHEDULE-0080-1` | `SCENARIO-0080-1` schedule / movement | **IMPLEMENTED / PASS — scenario-scoped Nested Starmap FIELD_POLICY-sourced schedule/movement** — deterministic opt-in/default-off step driver that consumes `PRODUCTION-PATH-0080-1` and turns read-only FIELD_POLICY composite-gap terms into live movement via `Threshold + EmitEvent → BoundaryRequest`, routed through the existing mobility/transfer substrate posture (Terran + Pirate ships); preserves identity + owner overlays, updates membership without reparenting; **not a global default schedule; no observation/control/demo; no direct move; no new substrate**.

## 11. SCENARIO-0080-1 PR ladder (Codex develops; Opus design-authority at the gates)

**Gate protocol.** Opus (design authority) authors/adjudicates every **OPEN** rung (the opening spec is
the gate: scope, bounds, stop conditions, named-but-unimplemented tests) and adjudicates every
**ACCEPT** review. Codex develops the **IMPL** rungs between gates. Each IMPL rung must: implement only
within the accepted opening spec; keep all prior `0080-0` and `0080-1` regression suites green; hold
CPU-oracle bit-exact parity (I8) for any GPU-resident field; ship one compact impl report; update the
ladder index + mapping guidance + worklog; and **stop-and-escalate to Opus** on any stop-condition
crossing (default-on session wiring, real-time loop, UI framework, direct movement control, hard
currency/markets/trade/`ai_budget`, nested Resource Flow depth, semantic/raw WGSL, capture-as-reparenting,
owner-as-spatial-parent, ClauseThing, invariant edit) rather than proceeding. Openings are docs-only;
implementations are opt-in/default-off and reversible.

| Rung | PR id | Deliverable (Codex, unless OPEN) | Gate (Opus) | Depends on |

**Sequencing note (design authority):** implement the two parked substrates **serially, not in parallel** —
rung 1 (atlas) is the structural prerequisite the scenario needs to exist at all; rung 2 (econ-scale) is the
heavier lift. If pace demands, rungs 3–7 may prove out the nested structure + inherited-overlay decisions on
atlas first, and fold the pirate's **full-economy** contention (rung 2's consumer) into a later production-path
sub-slice — keeping each parity surface clean.

## 12. Next track: full-vertical SimThing dress rehearsal (SCENARIO-0080-2 → engine)

### 12.0 Harness handoff — canonical citations (cite on every handoff)

**Codex cites this high-signal set on every rung handoff (keep to these; everything else is reachable
from them). They anchor each handoff to the three things that must not drift — FIELD_POLICY principles, the
GPU-resident Accumulator resource-flow notion, and the anticipated emergent behaviors:**
1. **[`design_0_0_8_1.md`](design_0_0_8_1.md) §0** — transient constitution: conformance; **all conflict
   is resource flow**; recursive allocation; **FIELD_POLICY = GPU-resident threshold crossings, no CPU planner**
   (§0.0, §0.5 #4); §0.5 harness discipline.
2. **[`invariants.md`](invariants.md)** — binding rules: **"Scenario Proof"**; **AccumulatorOp v2** +
   **Resource Flow Substrate** sections (the GPU-resident flow contract); FIELD_POLICY/JIT closure-posture.
3. **This file, §12–§12.5** — rehearsal + pre-rehearsal design (architecture, EC1/EC2, nested-grid,
   ATLAS-BATCH-0, retirement map + coverage). **§12.4 links the OWNER design of record + parked
   `mobility_owner0.rs`** (masked reduction — reachable here, not duplicated as a top-level link).
4. **[`scenarios/scenario_0080_2_dress_rehearsal_spec.md`](scenarios/scenario_0080_2_dress_rehearsal_spec.md)**
   — the **concrete scenario** (13 systems, factory/pop/starport economy, numbers, disruption-as-blockade)
   **and the anticipated emergent behaviors (§8.1)** the closing report verifies.
5. **[`../crates/simthing-core/src/accumulator_op.rs`](../crates/simthing-core/src/accumulator_op.rs)** —
   the **GPU-resident Accumulator primitive**: `SourceSpec` / `CombineFn` / `GateSpec` / `ScaleSpec` /
   `ConsumeMode` — the vocabulary every arena (labor / production / disruption / combat) compiles down to.
6. **[`workshop/field_policy_track.md`](workshop/field_policy_track.md)** — the **FIELD_POLICY charter /
   principles**: field-as-policy; decisions are GPU-resident threshold crossings → `BoundaryRequest`;
   no CPU planner.

**Anchors (every handoff holds all three):** **FIELD_POLICY principles** → links 1, 2, 6; **GPU-resident
Accumulator resource flow** → links 1, 2, 5; **anticipated emergence** → link 4 (§8.1). OWNER masked
reduction is reachable via §12.4 (link 3).

**Established decisions (do not re-derive — implement within these):**
- `Location` is the FIELD_POLICY field primitive (gridcell); **non-`Location` SimThings participate in resource
  flow normally.** `StarSystem`/`Station` are **deprecated — do not use.** `kind` is an install-time
  selector only, never a runtime branch (§0.1).
- A Location arranges its gridcell children's flow data in **dense, grid-ordered 2-D cells**
  (`cell(x,y) = map_base + y·width + x`); the buffer-is-the-map view is free (§12.2).
- The **cell is its own slot**; a planet (feature) and patrol/pirate (movers) are **occupants** that
  contribute *into* it — **per-channel/per-owner, never merged** (§12.3 EC-A3).
- Multi-owner routing at a cell = the **OWNER masked reduction** (mask-then-sum per identity); a
  faction's overlays mask **down** from the GameSession owner-entities; **capture = owner-column flip,
  never reparenting** (§12.4). **The 2-D arrangement does not alter the OWNER directives — addressing
  (where a cell sits) and identity/masking (how flows route) compose; they do not conflict.**
- Dense field/heatmap + **sparse REENROLL movers**; settling depth is **emergent** (§0.2).
- Build atlas batch allocation on a **static** map first (ATLAS-BATCH-0, §12.3); the **sparse-residency
  scheduler (M-4A) and REENROLL stay parked** until R5.
- **Rung sequence + which parked phase each rung proves/closes: §12.5** (one parked phase per rung).

---

**Why.** Every 0080 slice so far — `0080-0` Local Patrol Economy, `0080-1` Nested Starmap, and the
`SCENARIO-0080-2` Pirate Gradient Pathfinding rung ladder — was **proven at the math/behavioral
layer**: the recurrences, fields, dual-output gradient, FIELD_POLICY threshold-gated movement, and bit-exact
deterministic replay all hold and remain valid as **CPU oracles**. Under the constitution's
`invariants.md` "Scenario Proof" bar, none is yet proven **through a real SimThing reduction** — they
run on plain `Vec`/struct math with no `SimThing`/`SimProperty`/`Overlay`/`BoundaryProtocol`. This
track closes exactly that gap and validates SimThing **verticality in totality** in one assembled,
opt-in/default-off session.

**Tree under test:**

```
gamesession (root simthing)
  ├─ Terran faction       (+ techtree capability tree)
  ├─ worldstate
  │     └─ starmap gridcell simthings   (disruption + desirability columns live here)
  └─ Pirate faction       (+ techtree capability tree)
```

- **gamesession (root):** carries the global decay parameters as a root **overlay** — read-side
  weights the opt-in columns READ, not a column-wide write and not a global default schedule (the
  approved "gravity to zero" posture). Owns the boundary cadence.
- **worldstate → gridcell simthings:** the starmap. `disruption` is a real `SimProperty` **column on
  each gridcell simthing**, advanced by `AccumulatorOp` (pirate presence emits +, patrol presence
  emits −, root overlay decays it, clamp ceiling). The compound **desirability** is a derived column
  read-only over `disruption`; the **`GradientXY`** kernel runs over the worldstate gridcell slot range.
- **Terran faction (+ techtree):** capability-tree unlocks contribute **retention / suppression
  modifiers** as read-side overlay weights (≤1, acceleration-only on decay) and patrol presence —
  validating capability tree → overlay → column influence with no destructive writes.
- **Pirate faction (+ techtree):** the mover. Movement **emerges** from the gridcell desirability
  gradient via `Threshold`+`EmitEvent`→`BoundaryRequest` (exactly one step per boundary, no CPU
  planner); its techtree modifies disruption emission and movement threshold.

**Principles carried from 0080 (proved as math; to be re-proved through the engine):**

| Principle (0080 origin) | Re-validated through the engine as… |
|---|---|
| BoundedFeedback disruption decay (0080-2 rung 1) | `disruption` `SimProperty` column on gridcell simthings; `AccumulatorOp` recurrence; root-overlay decay weight |
| Decay/patrol modifiers as read-side params (0080-2 rung 1) | faction **techtree capability** → overlay weights composed onto the column (≤1, acceleration-only) |
| Compound desirability field (0080-2 rung 2) | derived desirability column, read-only over `disruption`, per gridcell |
| Dual-output `GradientXY` (0080-2 rung 3) | `StructuredFieldStencilOp::GradientXY` over the worldstate gridcell slot range, now wired into a session |
| FIELD_POLICY field-as-policy movement (0080-2 rung 4; 0080-0/1 patrol/ship FIELD_POLICY) | pirate movement via `Threshold`+`EmitEvent`→`BoundaryRequest`, one step/boundary, no CPU planner |
| Disruption/desirability as faction-economy signals (0080-0/0080-1) | gridcell columns read by faction overlays; pirate as adversarial participant |
| Deterministic replay / I8 bit-exact parity | same inputs → identical resolved GPU/CPU values across two runs of the assembled session |

**This is the first scenario authored to satisfy the new "Scenario Proof" gate.** Tier-2 (new
assembled session; gridcell columns wired into a session pass graph). §8 stop conditions still bind:
it pulls the mapping/RegionCell + AccumulatorOp + FIELD_POLICY substrates through one tree; it does **not**
open atlas production runtime, nested-RF depth, hard currency, ClauseThing/L3, or a real-time/UI loop.

> Dense per-cell temporal memory stays separately gated. The gridcell `disruption` column here is
> per-cell **state advanced across boundaries** by the standard AccumulatorOp + root-overlay decay
> (the bounded-feedback contract) — i.e. the sparse-per-node math of 0080-2 now expressed over real
> cell simthings, **not** the deferred dense-temporal VRAM gate.

### 12.1 Provisional findings (2026-06-03 audit — to be firmed up before the dress-rehearsal opens)

> **Status: PROVISIONAL.** Captured from a design-authority audit of the prior mapping/FIELD_POLICY/0080 work.
> Not yet ratified into spec; the dress rehearsal exists to resolve them. Work continues here next.

**Gap findings — what prior "passing" work did and did not do:**

- **F1 — 0080 modeled no spatial structure.** The 0080 scenarios ran a **1-D line of 4–5 scalar nodes**
  (source comment: *"simple 1-D line"*; `y` always 0). No grid, no field, no heatmap. The token
  "heatmap" appears **nowhere** in the code.
- **F2 — the mapping track built real 2-D field machinery but never demoed a heatmap.** 10×10 grid,
  stencil diffusion, gradient extraction (M-5A–E), 100-cell→parent reduction via `field_urgency`, all
  **GPU/CPU bit-exact**. But the field was **hand-seeded** (`CallerManagedOneShotSeedThenZero`, not
  gameplay-produced), **never exported/rendered/demoed** as a heatmap (deliverable = parity asserts),
  and **never run through SimThing cells** (flat slot-range `0..100 → 100`, not children of a starmap
  SimThing). The acceptance bar was *numeric-pipeline correctness*, not a heatmap artifact.
- **F3 — engine and consumer never met.** Mapping proved the machinery and closed at "primitive proven,
  unconsumed"; the consumer that should have pulled it (0080-2) **bypassed it with the 1-D toy**.
- **F4 — FIELD_POLICY never consumed a heatmap for pathing/critical-path.** FIELD_POLICY-OBS scores an entity's **own
  overlays** (`ExactQ16WeightedSum`), not a spatial field; FIELD_POLICY-EVENT/PIPE/ACT are event→proposal
  downstream; FrontierV1-4's "FIELD_POLICY route" `validate_field_policy_v1_consumed()` only **asserts two kernel
  descriptors are registered** (field computed in the same fixture but never read by FIELD_POLICY); 0080
  "pathing" was a scalar `supply*100 − disruption*10 − security` over 2 nodes. `field_urgency`
  critical-path existed as plumbing over hand-seeds, never a gameplay-driven agent decision.
- **F5 — the connecting tissue was never implemented.** Both halves (*field → heatmap* and *FIELD_POLICY →
  action*) were built and "proven" separately; the loop **field → diffuse → gradient → FIELD_POLICY reads local
  cell → action** was never wired. Every prior "pass" satisfied the two ends and never the connection.

**Provisional design resolutions (from the §12 discussion — confirm tomorrow):**

- Falloff is **stencil diffusion**, not arena enrollment; **two-column model** — `disruption` (source,
  arena accumulator, BoundedFeedback decay) → `location_status` (sink, stencil-written falloff,
  strict-sink `source_col != target_col`). Neighbors are **not enrolled**; the dense pass sweeps the
  whole grid. Falloff is a property field, **not** an overlay (the decaying *ownership* signal is the overlay).
- **Sparse arenas + dense diffusion**: arenas instance only on occupied cells; one stencil pass covers
  all 100 cells; they meet at the `disruption` column.
- **Diffusion horizon = FIELD_POLICY sight radius** (myopic local read sees H hops because diffusion pre-bakes
  distant info into the local gradient); **recursion (reduce-up / broadcast-down) = multi-resolution
  escape from local optima** (coarse starmap field biases the fine cell gradient).
- Grid-of-simthings requires **contiguous, row-major slot allocation** for the stencil's neighbor
  arithmetic — prerequisite to confirm/build in `SlotAllocator`.
- Ownership is a **decaying owner overlay** (D=2), not an ownership tree-node (rejected D=3 — the
  canonical §0.0 conformance violation).

**Proposed hard exit criteria (provisional — these would have failed every prior "pass"):**

- **EC1 (heatmap):** the starmap SimThing holds a **non-trivial reduced disruption field over its 100
  child gridcell SimThings**, produced by **pirate/patrol presence (not hand-seeded)**, verified against
  a CPU oracle, and **emitted as an inspectable heatmap artifact**.
- **EC2 (FIELD_POLICY consumption):** a mover's FIELD_POLICY evaluation **reads the diffused heatmap gradient at its own
  cell**, and the **emitted action is a function of that gradient** (verified against a CPU oracle) —
  **not** a hand-seeded field or a registration-only stand-in. The field → gradient → FIELD_POLICY → action loop
  is closed end-to-end through real SimThings.

### 12.2 Key concept — the recursive nested-grid field hierarchy (design note)

> **Status: PROVISIONAL design note (2026-06-03).** The substrate concept the EC1/EC2 exit criteria
> build on. Not yet a gate.

**The idea.** `Location`-kind SimThings are the FIELD_POLICY field primitives ("gridcells"). Any non-Location
SimThing participates in resource flow like everything else. A gridcell knows its `(x, y)` within its
parent's grid; every gridcell enrolls in the `location_val` flow arena. **Every gridcell that is a
parent of gridcells maintains a 2-D map siloing its children's reduced values at each child's `(x, y)`.**
Aggregate / velocity evaluation happens at that tier on the 2-D map, and a summary reduces up to the
parent (gridcell or not). It is **sparse** — only gridcells with gridcell children materialize a map —
and **recursive**: planet surface → planet/moon map → star system → galactic starmap share one
reduction/evaluation behavior.

**The "for free" property (storage), and its one condition.** The value buffer is
`n_slots × n_dims × 4 B` and the stencil addresses cells as `slot = base + row·width + col`. **If slots
are laid out to mirror topology, the buffer *is* the nested 2-D maps — a view, not extra memory.** A
system's 100 child cells as one contiguous row-major block already *is* its 10×10 map; the 2000 system
slots in galactic-grid order already *are* the galactic map. So nested 2-D legibility is free in
**storage**, conditioned on **slot layout mirroring grid topology at every tier**.

**VRAM at 2000+ systems × 10×10 (the field is not the constraint):** ~200K leaf cells + ~2K systems ≈
202K field slots.

| `n_dims`/cell | Single buffer | Ping-pong (×2) |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | 6.4 MB | 12.8 MB |
| 16 | 12.9 MB | 25.6 MB |
| 32 | 25.6 MB | 51.2 MB |
| 64 | 51.2 MB | 102 MB |

A realistic cell (~16–24 cols) puts the whole galactic field at **~25–80 MB double-buffered** — trivial.
**Breadth (2000 systems) is free; depth (recursion) is the cost:** full recursion (a 10×10 planet
surface under *every* leaf) is ~20M cells ≈ 1.3 GB — which is exactly why **sparsity (only occupied
interior nodes materialize a deeper grid)** is the binding cost lever, not VRAM at the top tier.

**What is *not* free:** (a) the rigid grid-ordered contiguous slot layout — reserves full dense tiles
even when mostly empty, and resists REENROLL slot recycling; (b) per-tier compute (stencil / `GradientXY`
/ reduction / velocity passes) — cheap and parallel, but real; (c) reducing children to the parent
collapses 2-D to a scalar, so the parent keeps **both** the child block (free 2-D map) **and** a +1
summary column.

**Proven/parked service map:**
- per-system 10×10 tiles batched in one buffer = the parked **ATLAS** substrate (C-2 closed the
  designer surface for bounded **algebraic tile-local G=0**, homogeneous-square tiles — exactly 2000
  homogeneous 10×10 masked tiles). **This design is the named multi-theater consumer that opens the
  parked atlas production-runtime gate (§4).**
- fine atlas (leaf cells) + coarse galactic grid (system reductions) = the multi-resolution pair; both
  are single-grid stencil fields.
- `StructuredFieldStencilOp` diffusion, `GradientXY`, `SlotRange` reduction, `field_urgency` EvalEML,
  `VelocityMonitor` (explicit prev-column) — **all proven, reusable.**
- **One genuinely new primitive:** the reduction target is *a cell `(x,y)` in the coarser parent grid*
  (not a free-standing scalar), applied recursively — "silo the child block into the parent's 2-D map."

**Decision that determines everything — slot layout fork:**
- **Dense, grid-ordered, contiguous** (recommended default): free 2-D view, cheap slot-arithmetic
  stencil, atlas-batchable — but reserves full grids and resists REENROLL.
- **Sparse with explicit `(x,y)` coordinate columns:** saves slots, REENROLL-friendly — but needs a
  scatter/gather to assemble the 2-D map and forfeits slot-arithmetic neighboring.
- **Recommended split:** the **field/heatmap is dense** (per materialized tier, atlas-batched, free 2-D
  view), the **movers (fleets) are sparse** and REENROLL between cells, layered on top of the dense
  field. Sparsity lives at *which tiles materialize at all*, not within a tile.

**Conformance note:** binding `Location` ⇒ field-primitive is conformant **iff** `kind` is only the
install-time selector (which cells get `location_val` + the 2-D-map column when they have gridcell
children); the runtime still reads behavior from properties/overlays/arena registrations and never
branches on `Location` (§0.0/§0.1).

### 12.3 Pre-Rehearsal track — `ATLAS-BATCH-0` (build + validate before the dress rehearsal)

> **Status: PROVISIONAL track definition (2026-06-03), design authority. Tier-2** (opens the parked
> atlas production-runtime gate — **batch allocation only**). To be laddered and accepted before the
> dress rehearsal (§12) opens.

**Purpose.** Stand up and prove **atlas batch allocation** on a **static, pre-generated** multi-theater
map — the named multi-theater consumer the M-4 / M-4A atlas runtime gate was parked for (constitution
§4; C-0/C-1/C-2 closed the designer surface). The static map deliberately **isolates batch allocation**
from the **sparse-residency scheduler (M-4A)** and from **REENROLL** — both stay parked (a static map
exercises neither). Establishes the Location-kind gridcell primitive and the 2-D-map storage that the
dress-rehearsal EC1/EC2 build on.

**Scope — what this track builds:**
1. **Simple static map generator (simulated).** Produces a fixed atlas at game start: a galactic
   **100×100 grid with ~1000 stars** dispersed (random or galaxy-shaped algorithm); each star system's
   **10×10 subgrid** with planet-system positions; each planet system's subgrid with moon/orbital
   positions. **All static at game start.** No procedural-generation runtime — it is a test/fixture
   producer the batcher consumes.
2. **Location-kind gridcell primitive.** `Location` SimThings carry grid `(x,y)` and a `width×height`
   dense map; grid-placement allocation reserves a dense contiguous cell-slot range with
   `cell(x,y) = map_base + y·width + x` (the free 2-D view, §12.2). Sparse by tier (only Locations with
   gridcell children materialize a map). `Location` is an **install-time selector only** — the runtime
   never branches on kind (§0.1).
3. **Atlas batch allocation.** Pack the ~1000 homogeneous 10×10 star tiles (+ planet/moon tiles, batched
   per homogeneous size-class) into batched buffers with **algebraic tile-local `G=0` masking** (no
   inter-tile bleed; systems couple only via the galactic-tier reduction), within the declared
   `V78AtlasVramBudget`, with **mandatory VRAM-multiplier reporting**. One batched stencil dispatch flows
   over all tiles of a class; CPU-oracle bit-exact parity.
4. **2-D-map storage of children's flow results** (the §12.2 reduction-target-is-a-cell primitive,
   refined by the binding constraint below).

**BINDING CONSTRAINT — co-located children are never merged.** A Location MAY have **multiple children
at the same `(x,y)`** (e.g. a planet, a patrol fleet, and a pirate fleet in one cell). This **refines and
corrects §12.2's "child is the cell" simplification**: the **cell is its own dense map slot** (the
position); features and movers are **occupants** that contribute *into* the cell. Co-located occupants
are distinguished and **must not be collapsed into one figure**:
- The cell is **multi-channel** (and where needed **owner/faction-indexed**): a planet writes
  food/labor channels; a patrol writes patrol-presence; a pirate writes pirate-presence/disruption —
  distinct channels at the same `(x,y)`.
- The batcher's reduction is **per-channel (and per-owner), never a blind sum-by-position.** Two pirate
  fleets in one cell *do* sum within the pirate-presence channel (correct — more presence); a planet and
  a pirate in one cell **never** sum across their channels.
- Therefore: dense **cell** slots (the map, grid-ordered) + **occupant** children (features + movers)
  that scatter/reduce into the cell's appropriate channel keyed on `(x,y)` + role/owner. This is the
  dense-field / sparse-occupant split, with the **planet now correctly an occupant, not the cell.**

**Exit criteria (provisional):**
- **EC-A1:** the static generator deterministically produces the fixed atlas (galactic 100×100 + ~1000
  star 10×10 subgrids + planet/moon subgrids). **Clarification (2026-06-03):** the **closed**
  `SCENARIO-0080-2 ATLAS-BATCH-0-GEN` fixture is the **economy-rehearsal live map descriptor** from
  [`scenarios/scenario_0080_2_dress_rehearsal_spec.md`](scenarios/scenario_0080_2_dress_rehearsal_spec.md):
  **20×20 galactic grid, 13 systems (10 Terran + 3 Pirate)**, 10×10 system/planet surfaces — not the
  100×100 / ~1000-star stress atlas. The older 100×100 language remains a **stress/scale atlas-batching
  target** for PACK and M-4 acceptance; LOC/PACK/STORE for the dress rehearsal must consume the **20×20 /
  13-system** descriptor unless Opus authors a separate scale-stress fixture contract.
- **EC-A2 (split by design authority 2026-06-03):**
  - **EC-A2a (PACK, CPU-provable):** the batcher packs the homogeneous tiles with `G=0` algebraic
    masking within `V78AtlasVramBudget`, reports a **numeric** VRAM multiplier, and a **CPU oracle**
    proves the `G=0` no-inter-tile-bleed property + tile-local↔atlas coordinate round-trip.
  - **EC-A2b (PACK-GPU):** one **batched GPU dispatch per homogeneous tile class** (`AtlasMaskGpuOp`,
    `TileLocalMaskG0`) matches the CPU oracle within the established **`GpuVerified` tolerance
    (full-tile L∞ ≤ 1e-4)**, with `G=0` tile-local no-bleed proven. *(Design-authority correction
    2026-06-03: redefined from "bit-exact" — the f32 atlas stencil is `GpuVerified`, not
    `ExactDeterministic`; the atlas-mask GPU primitive + CPU oracle already exist in
    `simthing-gpu/src/atlas_mask.rs`.)* Contract: [`handoffs/dress_rehearsal_codex_handoff_4_atlas_batch_0_pack_gpu.md`](handoffs/dress_rehearsal_codex_handoff_4_atlas_batch_0_pack_gpu.md).
  - **EC-A2b-exact (DEFERRED — separate exact-arithmetic track):** true **bit-exact** (`f32::to_bits()`)
    GPU=CPU parity. Requires a **pinned fixed-point stencil**; not achievable on the f32 path. Not PACK-GPU.
- **EC-A3 (STORE, CPU storage shape):** a Location stores its gridcell children's flow results in the
  correct `(location, cell, channel, owner)` slots, and **co-located children at one `(x,y)` are
  preserved per-channel/per-owner and never blind-summed by position** — proven on a CPU oracle (the
  10-pirate-shared-cell case + a constructed planet+patrol+pirate cell). *(Design-authority split
  2026-06-03: STORE = CPU storage-shape proof; the **live OWNER masked-reduction runtime** — `EvalEML`
  `CMP_EQ` + `Sum` over owner-indexed columns — is proven on GPU as **EC-A3-gpu /
  `ATLAS-BATCH-0-STORE-GPU` (PASS, fixture composition only)**; the OWNER masked-reduction *runtime*
  and R3 remain parked.)* Contract: [`handoffs/dress_rehearsal_codex_handoff_5_atlas_batch_0_store.md`](handoffs/dress_rehearsal_codex_handoff_5_atlas_batch_0_store.md).
  The CPU oracle here is the reference the STORE-GPU slice checks against (§12.4 OWNER masked reduction).
- **EC-A4:** the residency scheduler (M-4A) and REENROLL remain unbuilt/parked — the slice is static.

**Rungs (provisional):**
1. `ATLAS-BATCH-0-GEN` — static map generator (fixture producer).
2. `ATLAS-BATCH-0-LOC` — Location-kind gridcell primitive + grid-placement slot allocation + multi-channel cell.
3. `ATLAS-BATCH-0-PACK` — atlas batch allocation + `G=0` mask + VRAM-multiplier + batched dispatch + CPU parity.

### 12.4 Established mechanism — OWNER routing (multi-owner flows in one cell)

> **Already-designed + parked substrate; the harness pulls it, does not re-derive it.** This is the
> routing mechanism for resource flows from multiple owners sharing one spatial location, and it is
> what implements §12.3 EC-A3 ("co-located children never merged").

**Design of record:** [`workshop/mobility_and_transfer_allocation.md`](workshop/mobility_and_transfer_allocation.md)
**§11** — *"the identity/ownership overlay: directing flows by property, not by structure"* (esp. **§11.1**
the masked reduction; **§11.5** the session clearinghouse topology). Acceptance review:
[`reviews/transfer_emission_registration_ownership_opus_review.md`](reviews/transfer_emission_registration_ownership_opus_review.md).
**Parked substrate code:**
[`../crates/simthing-spec/src/designer_admission/mobility_owner0.rs`](../crates/simthing-spec/src/designer_admission/mobility_owner0.rs)
(`MOBILITY-OWNER-0` — owner relations as explicit columns `{Faction, Species, Blueprint, Tech}`, latched
modifier overlays via deterministic owner-column matching; metadata/testable substrate, no production
runtime). Masked-reduction primitives:
[`../crates/simthing-core/src/accumulator_op.rs`](../crates/simthing-core/src/accumulator_op.rs)
(`EvalEML` select/`CMP_EQ` + `Sum` + `ScaleSpec::ByColumn` — **no new WGSL / `CombineFn` /
`AccumulatorRole`**).

**How it works (as designed — do not reinvent):**
- **Owner-entities live under the GameSession root, not in the spatial tree** (§11.5):
  `GameSession → { Faction A, Faction B, …, SpeciesRegistry, WorldStateMap }`. A faction owner-entity
  holds its capability trees, policies, stockpile, and **effective overlay set**; the WorldStateMap is
  pure spatial containment; cells/holdings/cohorts carry **owner-columns**. **Capture = owner-column
  flip, never reparenting.**
- **Modifier overlays mask down by owner-column matching** (latched, `DirtyOnly`, per-owner layered):
  a faction's effective overlays (combat bonus, tech, fight-or-flight policy) broadcast from its
  GameSession-level owner-entity onto each spatial SimThing's owner overlay, applied where the
  owner-column matches. This **is** the "inherited from the gamesession, masked onto each simthing's
  ownership overlay" path.
- **Flows route by masked reduction, not by structure** (§11.1): for each identity `F` present in a
  cell, `masked = value · (owner_column == F)` via an `EvalEML` select/`CMP_EQ` mask, then a contiguous
  `SlotRange Sum` of the masked values into a **per-identity column** on the cell. A planet, a patrol,
  and a pirate in one `(x,y)` are summed **per owner-identity into distinct columns** — never collapsed.
  EC-A3 *is* this masked reduction applied to co-located occupants.
- **Where the flow balances is emergent** (§0.2): the masked reduction climbs the spine to wherever
  supply meets demand (combat nets at the cell; an empire economy nets at the GameSession root) — one
  mechanism, emergent settling depth, not a per-relation `D` assignment.

**Harness establishes:** ATLAS-BATCH-0 (§12.3) materializes owner-columns on cells and proves the masked
per-owner reduction keeps co-located occupants distinct (EC-A3); the dress rehearsal (§12) reuses the
same OWNER routing for disruption / combat / economy flows. **Parked, not pulled here:** OWNER
*production-runtime gameplay*, Hybrid-Strata/faction-index ECON scaling, and any capture beyond
column-flip — each its own gate.

> **R1b (`RESIDENT-EVENTLOG-0`) — IMPLEMENTED / PARTIAL (full journal parity) 2026-06-05:** [`runtime_0080_0_r1b.rs`](../crates/simthing-driver/src/runtime_0080_0_r1b.rs) adds a GPU-staged resident event journal on the R1a substrate. **All seven structural event kinds** (`MoveRequest`, `DamageDelta`, `ZeroCohort`, `ShipCountDelta`, `LocalBirthRequest`, `FusionRequest`, `OwnerCodeFlip`) are journalized and consumed by a bounded CPU boundary pass with **exact aggregate and per-tick oracle parity**, no movement/combat/production/blockade tick rederivation, and R1a Tier-A + R6C checksum preserved. The GPU-written resident event journal now drives bounded CPU structural boundary maintenance. **Resident structural scatter/compact is NOT yet claimed** — the structural *decisions* are still computed by a self-consistent CPU decision witness and staged into the GPU journal (`structural_decisions_gpu_emitted = false`); moving that decision authority resident is `R1c`. A structural-drift failure mode (reconstructing the CPU witness from partial value-only Tier-A readback) was found and fixed by making the witness self-consistent while the GPU value loop runs resident in parallel (the GPU is not starved waiting on the CPU). **Load-bearing invariant (carried into R1c):** the CPU shadow stays a *complete, serializable, pausable* world mirror in CPU land even after the GPU holds authority — every Tier-A value and Tier-B structural field lives in the shadow, a boundary save is whole and GPU-independent (reloads/continues bit-identically on a CPU-only host), and resident tables are an acceleration of the shadow, never its replacement.

**R4 detail (exact-sqrt chain — design authority).** **Elevated to 0.0.8.1 §0.7 (transient constitution,
2026-06-11).** The binding rule below remains here as historical ledger context; active constitutional
wording lives in [`design_0_0_8_1.md`](design_0_0_8_1.md) §0.7 — do not treat this section alone as the
sole authority.

The FIELD_POLICY gradient magnitude must be
**exact-authoritative** so move/sit decisions are deterministic across GPU adapters (I8). Chain:
fixed-point `dx/dy` → **exact pre-sqrt mag2** (`m_jit_mag2_fixed_exact` / `ExactFixedPointDxDy`) →
**Candidate F sqrt** (`m_jit_mag_f_from_exact_mag2`, artifact hash `59ab4b2892e3c690` — LF-canonical re-pin 2026-06-11, SQRT-REPIN-0) → exact Euclidean
magnitude → threshold. Raw f32 `dx/dy` magnitude is `ApproximateDiagnostic` and **may not gate the
commitment** (invariants: "Exact Euclidean magnitude requires exact pre-sqrt mag2"; "Exact sqrt authority
is artifact-backed (Candidate F)"). The composite the mover reads is the **multi-channel cell weighted by
its masked-down disposition** (R3): a pirate weights low-patrol + high-opportunity (move toward clean
systems, through disruption it can pass); a patrol weights high-disruption (move *toward* it to suppress).
Same machinery — disposition is just the weight vector; sit-still is the below-threshold case.

**R5 detail.** Movement *is* the mobility substrate exercised in a real session pass: the FIELD_POLICY event
materializes a `BoundaryRequest` that re-enrolls the mover (REENROLL) and routes it via the parked
0.0.7.9 mobility/transfer substrate (IDROUTE identity preserved, no reparenting). This is the
"first non-test-support default `SimSession` path" the mobility gate was mapped to — coincident with the
movement rung rather than a standalone slice.

**Parked-inventory coverage audit (every constitution §3 parked track has a test home or a reason to stay parked):**

| Parked track (constitution §3 / §4) | Test home |
|---|---|
| 0.0.7.9 mobility/transfer: REENROLL, ALLOC, IDROUTE, GPU kernel, RUNTIME | **R5** |
| 0.0.7.9 mobility/transfer: OWNER | **ATLAS-BATCH-0** (masked-reduction storage) + **R3** (mask-down) |
| 0.0.7.9 mobility/transfer: ECON (clearinghouse + faction-index contention) | **R2** |
| Line A — nested Resource Flow (A-0, depth>2) | **R2** |
| Line C — atlas / multi-theater (batch allocation) | **ATLAS-BATCH-0** |
| simthing-spec / CLAUSE-SPEC (L0/L1/L2) | **PARKED / FUTURE ENTRY GATE** — exercised only when a new scenario (e.g. `SCENARIO-0080-3`) is authorized; not in-flight |
| EML Tier-2 temporal (`BoundedFeedback`/`Decay`, `VelocityMonitor`) | **R1** |
| `field_urgency` / `field_pressure` | **R2** |
| Capability-tree → modifier-overlay | **R3** |
| FIELD_POLICY ladder field-consumption (OBS/EVENT/PIPE/ACT) | **R4** |
| Exact sqrt Candidate F (+ `mag2_fixed_exact`) | **R4** |
| `GradientXY` (landed) | **R1 / R4** (consumed) |
| E-11B-5 / E-2B-5 fission-enrollment | **R5** (starport→ship) |
| Conflict-as-resource-flow (combat HP/Damage) | **R6** |
| Ship production reinforcement / friendly cohort fusion | **R6B** |
| Closeout integrity (FrontierV1, mapping first-slice) | **R7** |

**Stay gated — no consumer in this scenario (correct to leave parked):** B-1 hard currency (no hard
currency); ClauseThing/ClauseScript L3 (no front-end); dense per-cell temporal memory (bounded-feedback
per-cell, not dense temporal); atlas sparse-residency scheduler / M-4A (static map); FrontierV2-5;
Hybrid-Strata ECON scaling beyond the 2-faction set (Terran/Pirate ECON-SCALE is reused, not extended).

**SimThing Studio (Bevy editor shell — BEVY-MAPGEN-EDITOR-PR1/PR1R/PR2/PR2R/PR2R2/PR2R3/PR2R4/PR2R5/PR2R6/PR2R7/PR2R8, PROBATION):** Windows-only
`simthing-mapeditor` studio shell: borderless black window, detached floating egui generation panel (20%
width, 3% margin), 3D galaxy view from MapGenerator typed output + JSON report quality status.
Presentation/authoring only — no live simulation, no save/load sessions. PR2 adds hover/click star
selection, selected-system inspector, incident hyperlane highlight, and procedural starburst sprites.
PR2R repairs star visibility at overview scale and scopes shape params by selected galaxy shape so Disc
generation is not blocked by dormant spiral arm params; hyperlane visibility tuning is render-only.
PR2R2 strengthens starburst overview readability, adds render debug toggles, and makes hyperlane
near/mid/far visual fade camera-relative by segment midpoint; light-blue foreground lanes and darker
far lanes are presentation-only materials, not simulation GPU authority. PR2R3 splits star sprites into
render-only core/aura layers and applies camera-distance attenuation so overview stars read as crisp
points with minimal aura while close/selected stars can bloom locally. PR2R4 centralizes render-only
system anchors so stars, picking, base hyperlane endpoints, and selected incident-lane highlights share
the same render coordinate frame and height. PR2R5 halves the PR2R4 aura extent and applies an additional
25% distant-star luminosity falloff while preserving those anchors, lane fade, and shape-param scoping.
PR2R6 halves the PR2R5 maximum aura cap and adds a depth-0.5-to-horizon 1.0→0.75 taper to aura radius
and luminosity while preserving near-camera peak brightness.
PR2R7 adds a small gear-opened Settings dialog for live star-render tuning: base blur radius, falloff
distance, falloff blur-radius percentage, and falloff opacity. Changes update render metadata in place
without regenerating the galaxy; dialog position/values persist in Studio settings and remain bounded
away from the left control panel and right status panel.
PR2R8 replaces legacy star spawn data with stable star billboard instances derived from
`StudioSystemRenderAnchor`. Runtime settings and camera-relative depth now drive core size, aura radius,
opacity, and luminosity through Bevy material/transform presentation inputs without regenerating the
galaxy. Stars remain persistent generated-system billboards, not particles, and they continue to share the
same render anchors as picking, base hyperlane endpoints, and selected incident-lane highlights.
PR1R repairs shell contract
(warning-clickable greyed controls, mouse-delta orbit, hyperlane depth buckets). Bevy transforms,
camera-space coordinates, star size, sprite scale, aura alpha, bloom, hyperlane color/materials, and
lane alpha are render metadata; structural gridcell coordinates remain authoritative. Selection is
editor/view state only. Shape params remain scoped by selected shape; inactive/dormant params are visible
but not submitted, while CLI/generator validation stays fail-closed for submitted params. Clausewitz UI
import / HTML skin layer is a horizon goal.
