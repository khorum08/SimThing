## 1. Purpose

0.0.8.0 redirects effort from **substrate-ahead-of-need** to **consumer-pulled integration**
(`design_0_0_8_0.md` §1, §5). The 0.0.7.9 track proved large, correct, opt-in/default-off substrate
that nothing in production consumed — and generated hygiene loops (recombination soaks, accounting-over-
accounting, passive proof wrappers) while waiting for a consumer.

**This track operationalizes SCENARIO-FIRST authoring:** the next artifact is a **named product
scenario**, not another fixture, soak, replay, accounting summary, manifest, or substrate expansion.
A substrate's production-path gate opens **only because a named scenario consumes it** — never
speculatively.

This is not implementation. This is not a substrate track. This is not another proof wrapper.

**ClauseThing / ClauseScript** remains a horizontal future authoring surface. Scenario admission
must not assume ClauseThing support, but should avoid choices that would make a future ClauseThing
front-end impossible.

---

## 2. Operating doctrine summary

- **Guardrails at designer/spec admission; runtime enforces hard safety** (`design_0_0_8_0.md` §2.1;
  `invariants.md` two-layer guardrail placement).
- **Tier-1 fast-lane** — accepted, generic/semantic-free, opt-in/default-off, parity-backed,
  reversible work ships as one implementation PR + one test report + one status-row update
  (`phase_m_gating_and_doc_policy.md` §1).
- **Tier-2 gate** — new scenario gates, default `SimSession`, default schedule, gameplay surface,
  semantic WGSL, invariant edits, new architecture, or closed-ladder reopen.
- **Proven-capability stop rule** — no passive proof wrappers unless they unlock execution
  (`phase_m_gating_and_doc_policy.md` §6; 0.0.7.9 track §2.2).
- **One principle per class; no per-slice accretion** (`design_0_0_8_0.md` §2.5).

---

## 3. ClauseThing horizon non-goal

ClauseThing / ClauseScript is a **horizontal future designer-facing aspiration** — not active
scope for this track.

- This track does **not** open ClauseThing.
- This track does **not** require ClauseScript expressiveness.
- This track does **not** alter `simthing-spec`.
- Scenario packets should target the **current accepted `simthing-spec` admission surface**
  (L0/L1/L2 / CLAUSE-SPEC).
- Future ClauseThing compatibility is a **non-blocking horizon concern only** — avoid admission
  choices that would foreclose a later front-end, but do not design for ClauseScript now.

---

## 4. Parked substrate inventory

Compact reference only — do not re-litigate. Each row is **complete or accepted at first slice,
opt-in/default-off, parked** until a named scenario pulls it.

| Capability | State | Opens when… |
|---|---|---|
| **0.0.7.9 mobility/transfer substrate** (ALLOC, REENROLL, IDROUTE, ECON, OWNER + RUNTIME-0/1A/1B + semantic-free GPU kernel substrate) | COMPLETE + PARKED | a named scenario needs mobility/ownership/economy in the default `SimSession` path |
| **Line A — nested Resource Flow (A-0)** | ACCEPTED, static nested first slice; production posture is `FlatStarResourceFlow` | a named economy needs depth>2 nested fanout |
| **Line B — discrete hard-currency ordering (B-0)** | ACCEPTED, narrow smoke; no B-1 | a named multi-transaction hard-currency workload |
| **Line C — atlas / multi-theater mapping (C-0/C-1/C-2)** | ACCEPTED; map batching CLOSED at designer surface | a named multi-theater scenario opens the atlas production runtime gate |
| **simthing-spec / CLAUSE-SPEC (L0/L1/L2)** | ACCEPTED designer-admission substrate | engine of this track's scenario authoring |
| **ClauseThing / ClauseScript (L3)** | PARKED pending product authorization | product authorizes the front-end |
| **Deferred-by-design** | E-11B-5, atlas production runtime, B-1, Hybrid-Strata/faction-index ECON scaling, FrontierV2-5, ACT/EVENT/OBS/PIPE | each requires its own named product scenario or product authorization — not open questions |

---

## 5. First gate: SCENARIO-0080-0

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Gate ID** | `SCENARIO-0080-0` |
| **Type** | Tier-2 scenario/admission gate |
| **Deliverable** | Named product-scenario / admission packet |
| **Packet** | [`scenarios/scenario_0080_0_admission_packet.md`](scenarios/scenario_0080_0_admission_packet.md) — **Local Patrol Economy** — **ACCEPTED 2026-06-02** ([acceptance review](tests/phase_scenario_0080_0_acceptance_review_results.md)) |
| **Design-authority enrichment** | Patrol relocate decision sourced from the accepted GPU-resident SEAD `Threshold`+`EmitEvent`→`BoundaryRequest` posture (not a CPU planner; no new substrate pulled) — scenario exercises SEAD + Ownership + Flow |
| **Runtime implementation** | **No** |
| **On acceptance** | Opened **only** the mobility/transfer production-path gate (`PRODUCTION-PATH-0080-0`, below) |

---

## 6. SCENARIO-0080-0 admission packet — required declarations

The admission packet must declare:

1. **Scenario name and product purpose**
2. **User-facing / product behavior** the scenario is meant to enable
3. **Which one parked substrate** it consumes (exactly one)
4. **Why that substrate is required now** (consumer pull — not speculative substrate build)
5. **Bounds and scale**
6. **Designer/spec admission vocabulary**
7. **Rejection vocabulary and diagnostics**
8. **Runtime path requested**, if any
9. **Whether production default path is requested**
10. **Whether default schedule is requested**
11. **Whether gameplay-facing integration is requested**
12. **Test/evidence needed for admission**
13. **Explicit non-goals**
14. **Exit criteria for acceptance**

Acceptance is **design-authority + product only**. No self-acceptance.

---

## 7. Recommended first candidate (not authorization)

**Most-ready candidate:** 0.0.7.9 mobility/transfer substrate.

**Reason:** Its production-path gate is already mapped as the first non-test-support default
`SimSession` path / default schedule (0.0.7.9 track top status; MOBILITY-SCENARIO-0 accepted the
scenario discipline).

**Constraint:** It must still be **pulled by a named product scenario**. Do not open
`PRODUCTION-PATH-0080-0` speculatively.

---

## 8. Stop conditions

Reject the scenario if it requires any of:

- owner-entity as spatial parent
- capture-as-reparenting
- semantic/raw WGSL
- default-on behavior without a production gate
- hard-currency through Resource Flow
- CPU planner / urgency / commitment emission
- reopening atlas runtime, E-11B-5, B-1, ClauseThing/L3 front-end, FrontierV2-5, ACT/EVENT/OBS/PIPE,
  Hybrid-Strata/faction-index scaling, or any closed ladder without its own product authorization
- passive proof wrappers that do not unlock execution

| `DEFAULT-SCHEDULE-0080-0` | Scenario-scoped schedule for Local Patrol Economy | **IMPLEMENTED / PASS - 1A schedule + patrol and 1B bounded pirate loop** — deterministic opt-in step driver routes GPU-resident SEAD threshold/event/`BoundaryRequest` decisions into `PRODUCTION-PATH-0080-0`; pirate is a second IDROUTE identity, not a second economy owner; pirate disruption, supply drain, threshold relocation, `local_security` evasion scoring, and deterministic cat-and-mouse assertions are implemented; **not a global default schedule**.

Pulls two parked substrates (below). Packet: [`scenarios/scenario_0080_1_admission_packet.md`](scenarios/scenario_0080_1_admission_packet.md). |

| `DEFAULT-SCHEDULE-0080-1` | `SCENARIO-0080-1` schedule / movement | **IMPLEMENTED / PASS — scenario-scoped Nested Starmap SEAD-sourced schedule/movement** — deterministic opt-in/default-off step driver that consumes `PRODUCTION-PATH-0080-1` and turns read-only SEAD composite-gap terms into live movement via `Threshold + EmitEvent → BoundaryRequest`, routed through the existing mobility/transfer substrate posture (Terran + Pirate ships); preserves identity + owner overlays, updates membership without reparenting; **not a global default schedule; no observation/control/demo; no direct move; no new substrate**.

Commands never move a ship, emit an external `BoundaryRequest`, or bypass SEAD (movement still emerges from the implemented `Threshold + EmitEvent -> BoundaryRequest` schedule).

## 11. SCENARIO-0080-1 PR ladder (Codex develops; Opus design-authority at the gates)

**Gate protocol.** Opus (design authority) authors/adjudicates every **OPEN** rung (the opening spec is
the gate: scope, bounds, stop conditions, named-but-unimplemented tests) and adjudicates every
**ACCEPT** review. Codex develops the **IMPL** rungs between gates. Each IMPL rung must: implement only
within the accepted opening spec; keep all prior `0080-0` and `0080-1` regression suites green; hold
CPU-oracle bit-exact parity (I8) for any GPU-resident field; ship one compact impl report; update the
ladder index + mapping guidance + worklog; and **stop-and-escalate to Opus** on any stop-condition
crossing (default-on session wiring, real-time loop, UI framework, direct movement control, hard
currency/markets/trade/`ai_budget`, nested Resource Flow depth, semantic/raw WGSL, capture-as-reparenting,
owner-as-spatial-parent, ClauseThing, invariant edit) rather than proceeding. Openings are docs-only;
implementations are opt-in/default-off and reversible.

| 9 | `DEMO-0080-1-IMPL-0` | Headless demo/export library helper (default **No CLI binary**) | **ACCEPT** | rung 7 (or 8) |
| 10 | `SCENARIO-0080-1-CLOSE-0` | *(Opus adjudicates)* Closeout / park review of the full vertical slice | **OPEN** (adjudicate close/park) | rungs complete |

**Sequencing note (design authority):** implement the two parked substrates **serially, not in parallel** —
rung 1 (atlas) is the structural prerequisite the scenario needs to exist at all; rung 2 (econ-scale) is the
heavier lift. If pace demands, rungs 3–7 may prove out the nested structure + inherited-overlay decisions on
atlas first, and fold the pirate's **full-economy** contention (rung 2's consumer) into a later production-path
sub-slice — keeping each parity surface clean.

## 12. Next track: full-vertical SimThing dress rehearsal (SCENARIO-0080-2 → engine)

**Why.** Every 0080 slice so far — `0080-0` Local Patrol Economy, `0080-1` Nested Starmap, and the
`SCENARIO-0080-2` Pirate Gradient Pathfinding rung ladder — was **proven at the math/behavioral
layer**: the recurrences, fields, dual-output gradient, SEAD threshold-gated movement, and bit-exact
deterministic replay all hold and remain valid as **CPU oracles**. Under the constitution's
`invariants.md` "Scenario Proof" bar, none is yet proven **through a real SimThing reduction** — they
run on plain `Vec`/struct math with no `SimThing`/`SimProperty`/`Overlay`/`BoundaryProtocol`. This
track closes exactly that gap and validates SimThing **verticality in totality** in one assembled,
opt-in/default-off session.

**Tree under test:**

```
gamesession (root simthing)
  ├─ Terran faction       (+ techtree capability tree)
  ├─ worldstate
  │     └─ starmap gridcell simthings   (disruption + desirability columns live here)
  └─ Pirate faction       (+ techtree capability tree)
```

- **gamesession (root):** carries the global decay parameters as a root **overlay** — read-side
  weights the opt-in columns READ, not a column-wide write and not a global default schedule (the
  approved "gravity to zero" posture). Owns the boundary cadence.
- **worldstate → gridcell simthings:** the starmap. `disruption` is a real `SimProperty` **column on
  each gridcell simthing**, advanced by `AccumulatorOp` (pirate presence emits +, patrol presence
  emits −, root overlay decays it, clamp ceiling). The compound **desirability** is a derived column
  read-only over `disruption`; the **`GradientXY`** kernel runs over the worldstate gridcell slot range.
- **Terran faction (+ techtree):** capability-tree unlocks contribute **retention / suppression
  modifiers** as read-side overlay weights (≤1, acceleration-only on decay) and patrol presence —
  validating capability tree → overlay → column influence with no destructive writes.
- **Pirate faction (+ techtree):** the mover. Movement **emerges** from the gridcell desirability
  gradient via `Threshold`+`EmitEvent`→`BoundaryRequest` (exactly one step per boundary, no CPU
  planner); its techtree modifies disruption emission and movement threshold.

**Principles carried from 0080 (proved as math; to be re-proved through the engine):**

| Principle (0080 origin) | Re-validated through the engine as… |
|---|---|
| BoundedFeedback disruption decay (0080-2 rung 1) | `disruption` `SimProperty` column on gridcell simthings; `AccumulatorOp` recurrence; root-overlay decay weight |
| Decay/patrol modifiers as read-side params (0080-2 rung 1) | faction **techtree capability** → overlay weights composed onto the column (≤1, acceleration-only) |
| Compound desirability field (0080-2 rung 2) | derived desirability column, read-only over `disruption`, per gridcell |
| Dual-output `GradientXY` (0080-2 rung 3) | `StructuredFieldStencilOp::GradientXY` over the worldstate gridcell slot range, now wired into a session |
| SEAD field-as-policy movement (0080-2 rung 4; 0080-0/1 patrol/ship SEAD) | pirate movement via `Threshold`+`EmitEvent`→`BoundaryRequest`, one step/boundary, no CPU planner |
| Disruption/desirability as faction-economy signals (0080-0/0080-1) | gridcell columns read by faction overlays; pirate as adversarial participant |
| Deterministic replay / I8 bit-exact parity | same inputs → identical resolved GPU/CPU values across two runs of the assembled session |

**This is the first scenario authored to satisfy the new "Scenario Proof" gate.** Tier-2 (new
assembled session; gridcell columns wired into a session pass graph). §8 stop conditions still bind:
it pulls the mapping/RegionCell + AccumulatorOp + SEAD substrates through one tree; it does **not**
open atlas production runtime, nested-RF depth, hard currency, ClauseThing/L3, or a real-time/UI loop.

> Dense per-cell temporal memory stays separately gated. The gridcell `disruption` column here is
> per-cell **state advanced across boundaries** by the standard AccumulatorOp + root-overlay decay
> (the bounded-feedback contract) — i.e. the sparse-per-node math of 0080-2 now expressed over real
> cell simthings, **not** the deferred dense-temporal VRAM gate.

### 12.1 Provisional findings (2026-06-03 audit — to be firmed up before the dress-rehearsal opens)

> **Status: PROVISIONAL.** Captured from a design-authority audit of the prior mapping/SEAD/0080 work.
> Not yet ratified into spec; the dress rehearsal exists to resolve them. Work continues here next.

**Gap findings — what prior "passing" work did and did not do:**

- **F1 — 0080 modeled no spatial structure.** The 0080 scenarios ran a **1-D line of 4–5 scalar nodes**
  (source comment: *"simple 1-D line"*; `y` always 0). No grid, no field, no heatmap. The token
  "heatmap" appears **nowhere** in the code.
- **F2 — the mapping track built real 2-D field machinery but never demoed a heatmap.** 10×10 grid,
  stencil diffusion, gradient extraction (M-5A–E), 100-cell→parent reduction via `field_urgency`, all
  **GPU/CPU bit-exact**. But the field was **hand-seeded** (`CallerManagedOneShotSeedThenZero`, not
  gameplay-produced), **never exported/rendered/demoed** as a heatmap (deliverable = parity asserts),
  and **never run through SimThing cells** (flat slot-range `0..100 → 100`, not children of a starmap
  SimThing). The acceptance bar was *numeric-pipeline correctness*, not a heatmap artifact.
- **F3 — engine and consumer never met.** Mapping proved the machinery and closed at "primitive proven,
  unconsumed"; the consumer that should have pulled it (0080-2) **bypassed it with the 1-D toy**.
- **F4 — SEAD never consumed a heatmap for pathing/critical-path.** SEAD-OBS scores an entity's **own
  overlays** (`ExactQ16WeightedSum`), not a spatial field; SEAD-EVENT/PIPE/ACT are event→proposal
  downstream; FrontierV1-4's "SEAD route" `validate_sead_v1_consumed()` only **asserts two kernel
  descriptors are registered** (field computed in the same fixture but never read by SEAD); 0080
  "pathing" was a scalar `supply*100 − disruption*10 − security` over 2 nodes. `field_urgency`
  critical-path existed as plumbing over hand-seeds, never a gameplay-driven agent decision.
- **F5 — the connecting tissue was never implemented.** Both halves (*field → heatmap* and *SEAD →
  action*) were built and "proven" separately; the loop **field → diffuse → gradient → SEAD reads local
  cell → action** was never wired. Every prior "pass" satisfied the two ends and never the connection.

**Provisional design resolutions (from the §12 discussion — confirm tomorrow):**

- Falloff is **stencil diffusion**, not arena enrollment; **two-column model** — `disruption` (source,
  arena accumulator, BoundedFeedback decay) → `location_status` (sink, stencil-written falloff,
  strict-sink `source_col != target_col`). Neighbors are **not enrolled**; the dense pass sweeps the
  whole grid. Falloff is a property field, **not** an overlay (the decaying *ownership* signal is the overlay).
- **Sparse arenas + dense diffusion**: arenas instance only on occupied cells; one stencil pass covers
  all 100 cells; they meet at the `disruption` column.
- **Diffusion horizon = SEAD sight radius** (myopic local read sees H hops because diffusion pre-bakes
  distant info into the local gradient); **recursion (reduce-up / broadcast-down) = multi-resolution
  escape from local optima** (coarse starmap field biases the fine cell gradient).
- Grid-of-simthings requires **contiguous, row-major slot allocation** for the stencil's neighbor
  arithmetic — prerequisite to confirm/build in `SlotAllocator`.
- Ownership is a **decaying owner overlay** (D=2), not an ownership tree-node (rejected D=3 — the
  canonical §0.0 conformance violation).

**Proposed hard exit criteria (provisional — these would have failed every prior "pass"):**

- **EC1 (heatmap):** the starmap SimThing holds a **non-trivial reduced disruption field over its 100
  child gridcell SimThings**, produced by **pirate/patrol presence (not hand-seeded)**, verified against
  a CPU oracle, and **emitted as an inspectable heatmap artifact**.
- **EC2 (SEAD consumption):** a mover's SEAD evaluation **reads the diffused heatmap gradient at its own
  cell**, and the **emitted action is a function of that gradient** (verified against a CPU oracle) —
  **not** a hand-seeded field or a registration-only stand-in. The field → gradient → SEAD → action loop
  is closed end-to-end through real SimThings.
