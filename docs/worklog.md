## 2026-05-16 — simthing-feeder crate scaffolding

**Status:** `simthing-feeder` crate landed on `claude/feeder-scaffolding`.
Three sub-roles from design_v4.md §11 wired together with a full
GPU-integration test proving the end-to-end chain.

**Landed in this session:**
- New workspace member `crates/simthing-feeder/` (added to root `Cargo.toml`).
- `src/work.rs` — `PatchTransform`, `BoundaryRequest`, `FeederWork`,
  `FeederSender` (Clone) + `FeederReceiver` over `std::sync::mpsc`,
  `feeder_channel()`. `FeederError::Disconnected` surfaces dropped-receiver
  failures cleanly. 5 unit tests.
- `src/patcher.rs` — `TransformPatcher`. `drain(receiver, registry,
  allocator, n_dims, &mut shadow) -> PatcherStats` resolves
  `SubFieldRole → col` via `col_for_role` only (I1, I5), mutates the CPU
  shadow, parks boundary requests, tracks dirty rows for coalesced GPU
  uploads. 8 unit tests covering all op kinds, all skip paths, and
  dirty-row bitmap semantics.
- `src/dispatcher.rs` — `DispatchCoordinator`. Owns the CPU shadow.
  `tick(...)` runs drain → dirty-row upload → Pass 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 7 →
  event readback → counter advance. Upload-before-snapshot ordering
  prevents phantom threshold crossings on patched cells.
- `src/maintainer.rs` — `TreeMaintainer` scaffold. `execute(Vec<BoundaryRequest>)
  -> MaintainerOutcome` classifies and counts each request; execution body
  lands in `simthing-sim`. The dispatch surface is final.
- `src/lib.rs` — public re-exports + topology diagram.
- `tests/integration.rs` — 4 GPU-required end-to-end tests:
  patch-through-channel-lands-on-GPU, day-boundary-fires-on-ticks-per-day,
  boundary-requests-reach-maintainer, many-patches-coalesce-to-one-upload.
- `docs/agents.md` updated: file layout includes the new crate, current
  state reflects Week 3 progress, "Not yet built" focuses on `simthing-sim`,
  test count bumped to 71.

**71/71 tests passing (14 core + 36 GPU + 17 feeder unit + 4 feeder integration),
zero warnings.**

**Design decisions made this session:**
- *CPU shadow over direct GPU writes.* The Patcher mutates a `Vec<f32>`,
  not GPU memory. Read-modify-write for `Multiply`/`Add` would otherwise
  need a per-patch GPU readback. The shadow also enables coalesced
  uploads (10 patches to the same row → 1 `queue.write_buffer`).
- *Upload before Pass 0.* Pass 0 snapshots `values → previous_values`.
  Uploading patches after the snapshot would make every threshold
  registered on a patched cell fire spuriously. Uploading first absorbs
  the patch into the previous-state reference frame, matching how the
  CPU evaluator already treats continuous overlays.
- *Tree Maintainer is a scaffold, not a stub.* The dispatch surface,
  outcome type, and request-routing are real and tested. Only the
  mutation execution body is deferred to `simthing-sim`. This keeps
  Invariant I7 ("structural mutations only at the day boundary")
  enforceable today: the Maintainer never sees the channel directly, and
  the within-day Patcher physically cannot touch the tree.
- *No OS threads in this crate.* The struct names match the design doc's
  "feeder thread architecture" terminology, but `tick()` is a method, not
  a loop. Thread placement is a top-level policy decision the eventual
  `simthing-sim` driver makes.

**Branch state:** `claude/feeder-scaffolding` — ready to push and PR.

**Next session:** `simthing-sim` crate. Day-boundary protocol orchestration
(design_v4.md §10), Tree Maintainer execution body, fission/fusion. The
`build_overlay_deltas` + `upload_overlay_deltas` + `upload_thresholds`
sequence at boundary time also lives there.

## 2026-05-16 — Week 3 begins: Pass 7 (threshold scan)

**Status:** Pass 7 fully built and parity-tested on `claude/week3-threshold-scan`.

**Landed in this session:**
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/world_state.rs`:
  - New Pod types: `ThresholdRegistration` (24 B) and `ThresholdEvent` (16 B).
  - Direction constants: `DIR_UPWARD`, `DIR_DOWNWARD`, `DIR_EITHER`.
  - Three new buffers on `WorldGpuState`: `threshold_registry`, `event_count`
    (4 B atomic `u32`), `event_candidates`. Placeholder allocations keep them
    bindable when no thresholds are registered.
  - New methods: `upload_thresholds`, `reset_event_count`, `read_event_count`,
    `read_event_candidates(n)`. `total_buffer_bytes()` updated.
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/shaders/threshold_scan.wgsl` — Pass 7. One thread per
  registration; strict crossing detection in three direction modes; `atomicAdd`
  into `event_count` for sparse output indexing.
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/passes.rs` — Pass 7 pipeline (6-binding layout).
  `run_threshold_scan(state)` resets the counter internally, then dispatches
  `ceil(n_thresholds / 64)` workgroups. New CPU oracle helper in tests.
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/lib.rs` — exports new types + direction constants.

**Tests added:**
- `upload_thresholds_grows_buffer_and_tracks_count` — buffer reallocates correctly.
- `reset_event_count_writes_zero` — counter reset works.
- `threshold_scan_matches_cpu_oracle` — bit-exact GPU/CPU parity across all
  three direction modes; covers stationary-on-threshold non-event case.
- `threshold_scan_no_registrations_is_noop` — empty registry doesn't panic.
- `threshold_scan_after_full_pipeline` — end-to-end Pass 0+1+2+3+7 with a
  velocity-driven crossing.

**50/50 tests passing (14 core + 36 GPU), zero warnings.**

**Branch state:** `claude/week3-threshold-scan` — ready to merge.

**Next session:** `simthing-feeder` crate scaffolding. Work queue + Transform
Patcher + Dispatch Coordinator per design_v4.md section 11.

## 2026-05-16 — Pass 3 complete

**Status:** Pass 3 (iterative overlay transform application) fully built, tested, and pushed on `claude/pass3-iterative-deltas`.

**Landed in this session:**
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/overlay_prep.rs` — CPU prep pass. `build_overlay_deltas(root, registry, allocator)` walks the tree depth-first mirroring `Evaluator::evaluate_node` step 5: ancestor overlays first, local overlays after, only emitting deltas for properties the node actually has. 5 unit tests cover the empty case, single local overlay, ancestor-before-local ordering, absent-property skipping, and all three op kinds.
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/shaders/transform_application.wgsl` — Pass 3 shader. One thread per slot. Walks `slot_delta_ranges[slot]` and applies each `OverlayDelta` in place to `values[]` via `switch (op_kind)`. n_slots/n_dims derived from `arrayLength()` so no uniform buffer is needed.
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/passes.rs` — Pass 3 pipeline (3-binding layout: `values` rw, `overlay_deltas` r, `slot_delta_ranges` r). `run_apply_overlays()` early-returns when `n_overlay_deltas == 0`. New test `pass3_overlay_matches_evaluator` covers Multiply + Add + Set at ancestor and local levels; bit-exact parity confirmed.
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/lib.rs` — exports `build_overlay_deltas`.
- 30/30 tests passing, zero warnings.

**Branch state:** `claude/pass3-iterative-deltas` — ready to merge (PR #4 open).

**What's left after merge:**
- Passes 4–6 (reduction) and Pass 7 (threshold scan) — deferred. Threshold registration API doesn't exist yet.
- `EvaluationBatch` struct (wrapper around WorldGpuState + per-tick upload) — Week 3 work.
- Feeder thread + day boundary protocol — Week 3.

## 2026-05-15 — Pass 3 scaffolding (rate-limited; not finished)

**Status:** session interrupted by rate limits before Pass 3 shader work could land. Scaffolding (decision + types + buffers + upload API) is in this branch and ready to merge.

**Decision adopted:** transform application is **iterative on GPU**, not affine matrix composition. See `docs/agents.md` → "Transform application — iterative on GPU (decided)" for the full rationale. Short version: bit-exact CPU/GPU parity becomes trivial (both sides walk the same delta list in stack order), GPU memory drops by ~370 MB at endgame scale, and per-tick GPU work is proportional to active overlays rather than `n_dims²`.

**Landed in this branch:**
- `docs/agents.md` — iterative-on-GPU section added; `WorldGpuState` buffer list updated; FMA section gained an "Outcome (Week 2)" note; `EvaluationBatch` sketch updated.
- `crates/simthing-gpu/src/world_state.rs`:
  - Removed dead `local_transforms` / `ancestor_transforms` buffers (no shader ever read them; their memory was the cost of an architectural plan we reversed).
  - Added `OverlayDelta` (`{col, op_kind, value, _pad}`, 16 B, Pod) and `SlotDeltaRange` (`{offset, length}`, 8 B, Pod).
  - Added `OP_MULTIPLY` / `OP_ADD` / `OP_SET` constants matching `TransformOp` cases.
  - Added `overlay_deltas` buffer (grows on demand via upload) and `slot_delta_ranges` buffer (fixed size = `n_slots × 8 B`).
  - Added `upload_overlay_deltas(&mut self, deltas, ranges)` — reallocates `overlay_deltas` if too small, then queues writes.
- 38/38 tests still passing, zero warnings.

**What's left for the next session to finish Pass 3:**
1. **CPU prep pass for delta collection.** New module (e.g. `crates/simthing-gpu/src/overlay_prep.rs`) with a tree walker that builds `(Vec<OverlayDelta>, Vec<SlotDeltaRange>)` from a `SimThing` tree + `DimensionRegistry` + `SlotAllocator`. Must carry the ancestor stack and emit ancestor deltas before local deltas in evaluation order, exactly mirroring `Evaluator::evaluate_node` step 5 (`local_stack.apply_to`). Resolve `SubFieldRole → col` via `col_for_role` only (Invariant I1).
2. **Pass 3 WGSL shader** (`crates/simthing-gpu/src/shaders/transform_application.wgsl`). Sketch in `docs/agents.md`. One thread per slot. `switch (d.op_kind) { 0 → Multiply; 1 → Add; 2 → Set }`. Workgroup size 64. Dispatch `ceil(n_slots / 64)` workgroups.
3. **Wire Pass 3 into `Pipelines`** (`crates/simthing-gpu/src/passes.rs`). Mirror the existing `run_velocity_integration` / `run_intensity_update` pattern: bind group layout with `values` (rw), `overlay_deltas` (read), `slot_delta_ranges` (read), uniform with `n_dims`. Add `run_apply_overlays(&self, state: &WorldGpuState)` — no `dt` parameter; Pass 3 is dt-independent. Early-return if `state.n_overlay_deltas == 0`.
4. **Parity test.** New test in `passes.rs` that builds a multi-node tree with non-trivial overlay stacks (mix of `Multiply` / `Add` / `Set` at different levels, ancestor and local), runs `Evaluator` on the CPU side and Pass 0+1+2+3 on the GPU, and asserts bit-exact match. Should be straightforward because both sides iterate deltas in the same order — no rounding-order divergence to worry about.
5. **Commit + push + PR.** Should be one focused PR titled something like "Pass 3 iterative transform application + parity test".

**Branch state:** `claude/pass3-iterative-deltas` is the active worktree branch.

**Gotchas to remember:**
- `upload_overlay_deltas` requires `&mut self` (it can reallocate). Tests will need `let mut state = WorldGpuState::new(...)` rather than the existing `let state = ...` pattern.
- The placeholder allocation strategy: empty `deltas` slice still uploads with `n_overlay_deltas = 0`, and the shader checks `range.length == 0` per slot rather than reading the buffer's overall length. So the placeholder 1-entry buffer is never actually read.
- `OverlayDelta` is 16 bytes with explicit `_pad` to keep the storage-buffer array stride unambiguous. Don't drop the pad.
- The CPU `Evaluator` is unchanged — that's the whole point of going iterative. Don't refactor `apply_to_data`.

**Open questions for the next session (low-priority, can be deferred):**
- Should `upload_overlay_deltas` reuse a staging buffer rather than recreating `overlay_deltas` each grow? At realistic overlay churn this rarely fires, so probably fine as-is.
- Pass 3's per-thread loop has variable length per slot. If some slots have very long stacks and most have none, GPU warps will idle. At our scale this is not a concern, but worth profiling once we have realistic overlay loads.
